In Selenium with Python, implicit and explicit waits are mechanisms to instruct the WebDriver to wait for a certain condition
to be met before proceeding with the next step in the test script. These waits help in managing the synchronization of the script
with the web elements' loading times, ensuring more reliable and stable test execution.

### Implicit Wait
Implicit wait tells the WebDriver to poll the DOM for a certain amount of time when trying to find any element (or elements)
if they are not immediately available. It applies to all elements in the test script.

### Explicit Wait
Explicit wait tells the WebDriver to wait for certain conditions to occur before proceeding further in the code. It allows
for more fine-grained control over waiting, specifying the condition to wait for, and how long to wait for that condition to be met.

Common Expected Conditions
When using explicit waits, you can wait for various conditions such as:

* --> presence_of_element_located: Waits for the element to be present in the DOM.
* --> visibility_of_element_located: Waits for the element to be visible.
* --> element_to_be_clickable: Waits for the element to be clickable.
* --> text_to_be_present_in_element: Waits for the text to be present in the specified element.
* --> title_is: Waits for the page title to be exactly a certain value.
* --> title_contains: Waits for the page title to contain a certain value.

Differences Between Implicit and Explicit Waits
Scope: Implicit wait applies to all elements in the script globally, while explicit wait is used for a specific element or condition.
Flexibility: Explicit wait provides more flexibility and control over waiting conditions.
Performance: Overusing implicit waits can slow down the execution of your script because it will apply the wait time to all elements globally.
 Explicit waits, being condition-based, can be more efficient.
Usage Recommendation
It's generally recommended to use explicit waits over implicit waits for better control and efficiency. Combining both types of waits
can lead to unexpected behavior and should be done cautiously. Implicit waits can be useful for simple synchronization needs,
 while explicit waits are more suitable for complex conditions and dynamic content.
